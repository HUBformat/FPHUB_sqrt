# Floating-Point Square Root (HUB Format)

## Overview

This module implements a custom **Digit Recurrence radix-2 floating-point sqrt** using a simplified, educational format referred to as **HUB**. The design supports normalized numbers only, and handles key IEEE 754-style special cases like ±zero, ±infinity and negative numbers. The goal is to offer a modular, understandable architecture for floating-point square root in digital systems.

The core component (`FPHUB_sqrt`) takes one input in HUB format and returns a correctly computed square root, managing alignment, normalization, and special cases.

## HUB Format

Each operand is composed of:

- 1-bit **sign**.
- E-bit **exponent**.
- M-bit **mantissa**, where the leading 1 is implicit (normalized form).

There are **no subnormals**. Even when the exponent is zero, the implicit one is still present in the mantissa.

---

## Key Features

- **Special case support**: Recognizes and handles special cases like ±0, ±∞ and negative values.

---

## Result Composition

After computations, the final result is assembled from:
- Sign bit (`res_sign`)
- Normalized exponent (`res_exponent`)
- Most significant bits of the mantissa (`res_mantissa`)

the output is a valid HUB-formatted floating-point number.

## Usage

You can try this module in isolation by yourself my running the `make` command. This will launch the testbench contained in `m̀ain.cpp`, which reads from a .csv file the expected inputs and outputs, and compares them with the ones provided by the main module. It also generates a `.vcd` trace file, which you can visualize with gtkwave or a similar program.

To integrate the divider into your own project:

1. **Instantiate** the top module `FPHUB_sqrt`.
2. **Provide input** `X` using the custom HUB format: `{sign, exponent, mantissa}`.
3. **Monitor** the `finish` output to detect when the operation has completed.
4. **Read** the output `res`, which will contain the final result in HUB format.

### Parameterization

The sqrt is **fully parameterizable**:
- You can adjust the number of exponent bits (`E`) and mantissa bits (`M`) via parameters.
- By default, the module uses **E = 8** and **M = 23**, which corresponds to a 32-bit floating-point format (1 + 8 + 23 bits).
- This allows easy scaling of precision for custom applications, embedded systems, or educational experiments.
